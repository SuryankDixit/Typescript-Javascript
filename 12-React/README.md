- Component Based Architecture.
    - Reusable code
- React is declarative not Imperative
    - tell react what you want and react will build UI
- In index.js: 
    - The app component is rendered inside the root DOM node.
    - Everything inside root will be controlled by react.
    - App component represents the view that we see in browser
- Component is basically just the code inside js and jsx file and describes a part of user interface 
- 2 Component Types:
    - Stateless Functional Component
        - absence of this keyword.
        - solution without using state
        - React 16.7.0-alpha -> hooks
        - hooks lets you use states without classes. 
    - Stateful Class Components
        - Class extending component class
        - Render method returning html.
        - can maintain a private internal state.
        - provide lifecycle hooks.
        - Stateful
    - both can receive props as an parameter and returns jsx.
- Export keyword
    - export default
    - export function (name export)
        - in this , we have to to use the same function name as of js file
- JSX (JavaScript XML)
    - contains tags, attributes and children.
    - Transpiles to JS which is understood by browsers.
    - React.createElement(arg1,arg2,arg3)
    - That's why we import React from react
    - Wrap all elemnts in a hierarchy of parent and child
- Properties (props)
    - optional input that components can accept
    - it is an object.
    - {props.anyKey}
    - props are immutable.
- State
    - an object privately maintained in an component
    - constructor(){super();this.state={}}
- props vs state
    - 
        - props get passed to the component
        - state is managed within the component
    - 
        - props are immutable
        - state can be changed
    - 
        - props, this.props
        - useState Hooks, this.state
